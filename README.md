# example_canister

This repo provides an example canister (Smart Contract) which can be used on the [Internet Computer Protocol](https://internetcomputer.org/). The canister is designed to allow developers to build on top of a core set of features while optionally including bolt-on features such as HTTP Outcalls, Timers and Stable Memory Storage. 
The minimum code required to compile the canister is the core module. On top of this you can add your own modules or use any/ all of the example modules.

## Getting Started
If you have not deployed a smart contact on the Internet Computer before, check out this guide to building on the IC using rust [here]( https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/rust/)
